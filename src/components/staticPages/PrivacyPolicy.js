                    We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not

                    through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                    (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction
                    data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your
                    purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
                    transaction information is not saved.

                  <p>
                    Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS
                    as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a
                    joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American
                    Express and Discover.

                  <p>
                    PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of
                    credit card information by our store and its service
                    providers.

                    In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
                    collect, use and disclose your information to the extent

                  <p>
                    However, certain third-party service providers, such as
                    payment gateways and other payment transaction processors,
                    have their own privacy policies in respect to the
                    information we are required to provide to them for your
                    purchase-related transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For these providers, we recommend that you read their
                    privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which
                    your personal information will be handled by these

                  <p>
                    In particular, remember that certain providers may be
                    located in or have facilities that are located a different
                    jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to
                    proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a
                    third-party service provider, then your information may
                    become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which
                    that service provider or its facilities are located.
