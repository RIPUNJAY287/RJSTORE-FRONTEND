                  Its hightime you wave Hi to good food and Bye to artificial
                  colours, preservatives and harmful adulterations!!!
                  <br />
                  At Food dude, we envision a healthy, natural and sustainable
                  food delivery, ensuring the best of quality checks being done,
                  before our food reaches your doorstep.
                  <br />
                  Let's be honest here. It's insane to compromise on the quality
                  of food. Being casual in this aspect can make you pay huge
                  hospital bills either in the vicinity or future.
                  <br />
                  We at Fooddude ensure that that our customers get the premium
                  of quality food without compromising with the quantity.
                  <br />
                  So what are you waiting for? Go satiate your hunger at the
                  comfort of your home by placing your first order today. We are
                  just a fingertip away!!!!
